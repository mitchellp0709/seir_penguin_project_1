## By J. Mitchell Paoletti 


## Introcution

The object of this game is to test the knowledge of the SEIR Penguin class' knowledge against that of me, Mitchell. To do this, I've created a trivia game where we take facts that I know, and see if the class knows them too.

## Technologies used

-HTML
-CSS
-JS
-jQuery

## Challenges
My biggest challenge was getting the trivia game to work in the console, then expanding it from there.

### I have trouble with...

I had a lot of trouble with my game double couting inputs and running through multiple questions every time a user clicked an answer. This was fixed by using the off() command in jQuery. 



My code looked like this:

```js
console.log("hello")
```

It was giving me a problem...... when it was fixed, it looked like this:

```js
console.log("much better!!")
```
